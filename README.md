## DSA Interview Preparation (India-Focused 🇮🇳)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice**
focused on **Indian technical interviews** (service + product companies).

---

## Learning Approach (Interview-First)

Instead of completing the full Grokking course, I follow this strategy:

- Focus only on **must-know DSA topics**
- Practice **frequently asked interview patterns**
- Start with **easy → medium → traps**
- Understand logic, edge cases, and time/space complexity
- Revise until I can **explain clearly in interviews**

🎯 Goal: **Clear interview rounds first, then master DSA deeply**
